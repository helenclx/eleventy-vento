# eleventy-vento

My experiment with using the [Vento](https://vento.js.org/) template engine in the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), utilising [eleventy-plugin-vento](https://github.com/noelforte/eleventy-plugin-vento).

## Run Locally

I used [Bun](https://bun.sh) as the JavaScript runtime to create this project, but you can use Node.js by replacing the `bun` in the following commands with `npm`, as Bun is a drop-in replacement for Node.js.

1. Clone this repository locally
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/helenclx/eleventy-vento.git
    ```
1. Install dependencies
    ```
    bun install
    ```
1. Run the project
    ```
    bun start
    ```
1. Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser
